Personalized products
Example: Persona Nutrition
This type of business operates a platform that offers customized products tailored to individual customer needs. Users typically begin by completing a detailed assessment, which is then analyzed to provide personalized recommendations. For example, in the case of nutrition, the platform might offer custom vitamin packs, but this model can extend to other product categories such as skincare, beauty, and wellness products. Each product is linked to specific SKUs, representing items tailored to the customer's preferences. The business model is often subscription-based, ensuring regular delivery of the customized products. Additionally, the platform may offer reordering features, customer support for further customization, and a feedback loop to refine future product recommendations based on user reviews and changing needs.
