Online clothing store
Example: Lululemon
This type of business usually operates an online and offline fashion retail platform that offers a diverse range of products categorized by department, category, and collection, and is tailored to various customer needs through uses, features, and fit types. The schema is centered on the Products table, which connects to departments, categories, collections, and is extended via junction tables for product uses and features. Each product links to one or more SKUs, which represent sellable items with inventory, pricing, and shipment details. Customer data is also extensively modeled, including multiple addresses, payment methods, loyalty membership, and order history, while promotional codes, returns, cancellations, and fulfillment options are designed to support scalable and efficient operations across both digital and physical retail channels.
